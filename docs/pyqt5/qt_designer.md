In Chapter 5 we created dialogs purely by writing code. In our initializers we
created the widgets we needed and set their initial properties. Then we created
one or more layout managers to which we added the widgets to get the
appearance we wanted. In some cases, when working with vertical or horizontal
layouts we added a “stretch” which would expand to fill unwanted space.
And after laying out the widgets we connected the signals we were interested
in to the methods we wanted to handle them.
