# Preface

Python is probably one of the few programming languages which is both simple and powerful. This is good for beginners as well as for experts, and more importantly, is fun to program with. This book aims to help you learn this wonderful language and show how to get things done quickly and painlessly - in effect 'The Anti-venom to your programming problems'.

## 读者对象

本书作为Python编程语言的指南或教程，主要面向初学者，同时对有经验的程序员也有帮助。

本书目的是，如果对于计算机，你只知道如何保存文本文件，那么你可以从本书学习Python。如果之前你有编程经验，那么你同样可以从本书学习Python。

如果您之前有过编程经验，你将对Python和你喜欢的编程语言之间的区别感兴趣——我高亮显示了这些区别。然而要提醒一点，Python将很快成为你最喜爱的编程语言！
